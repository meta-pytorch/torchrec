"""Unified metrics type for sync and async metric access.

Thread safety: This class relies on CPython's GIL for safe mutation of
_data and _resolved from Future callback threads. The GIL ensures that
attribute assignment is atomic, so concurrent reads of is_resolved() or
resolve() will see a consistent state. If used outside CPython (e.g.,
free-threaded Python 3.13t), a threading.Lock would be needed.

    Metrics container that wraps either a resolved dict or a pending Future.

    Provides a unified interface for both sync and async metric access:
    - subscribe(callback): async access, always works
    - resolve(): sync access, fails fast if backed by Future
    - update(other): deferred merge
    - is_resolved(): check without blocking

    Does NOT implement Mapping. Callers must use subscribe() or resolve()
    to access metric values. This prevents silent blocking in the training
    path when backed by a Future.
